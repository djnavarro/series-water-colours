# series-water-colours

Source code for the generative art gallery by Danielle Navarro at <https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/water-colours>. Code and images released under a CC-BY licence.

The `source` folder does contain the relevant source code used to generate the art, and similarly the `build` folder does contain scripts used when building manifest files etc. But: the code *hasn't* been updated to reflect the most recent workflow, and will probably attempt to generate output in the wrong folders.
